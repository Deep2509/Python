Que:- What are negative indexes and why are they used?
Ans:- Negative indexes in Python are a way to access elements from the end of a sequence, such as a string, list, or tuple. The last element in the sequence has an index of -1, the second-to-last element has an index of -2, and so on.
Negative indexes are used in Python for convenience when you need to access elements from the end of a sequence without knowing its length. They provide a concise and intuitive way to refer to elements relative to the end.
